						<h2>What is Bulimia Nervosa?</h2>
						<p>Bulimia Nervosa is a condition in which a person has problems in accepting what is considered by most to be normal weight. Binge eating or binging followed by self-induced vomiting (or throwing up) after eating may also be a characteristic of bulimic behaviours. </p>
						<p>Some people may also use laxatives or other medication to get food out of their bodies. People with bulimia often have a chaotic lifestyle, not only in terms of eating but also in terms of other aspects of their life. </p>

						<h2>How would I know if I or a relative or friend had Bulimia?</h2>
						<p>Sufferers from bulimia often feel ashamed or guilty, and may have particular difficulty talking to others about themselves or seeking help. You may notice someone throwing up, vomiting, binge eating or unusual eating habits. 
						You may not notice anything at all as people with an eating disorder become very skilful at hiding any signs of their illness.</p>
						<p>​By working from home I have reduced my costs enabling me to reduce the session fees for clients, making counselling online more accessible to people seeking counselling online.
						I have worked in the field of eating disorders counselling and therapy for several years both face to face and online counselling. I have helped many clients who struggle with food and the subsequent behaviours such as anorexia and bulimia which can affect people’s lives, focusing on the underlying life issues which contribute to food related problems, helping clients to learn to live a life free of the debilitating problematic use of food.</p>
