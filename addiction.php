						<p>​Addiction can take many forms, Alcohol, Gambling, Shopping, Sex and Exercise are just a few examples of issues which can become an addiction. Any addiction usually has an underlying reason, specialised addiction counselling is the most effective way of getting the help required.</p>

					<h2>What is Addiction and how does addiction counselling help?</h2>
					<p>An addiction is a regular compulsion, some specific activity which is usually damaging to our life balance and well-being, often we may not realise the behaviour or addiction is causing a problem until it is serious. 
					It is often a friend or family member that observes a problem long before the person with the addiction does. Addiction counselling helps and it’s important an addiction counsellor with specific skills is sought.</p>
					<p class="info">The term addiction is often used more commonly for drug and alcohol misuse but it is applied to other habits such as gambling, pornography, social network, sex or eating disorders. </p>
					<p>Something tends to be described as an addiction when it interferes with our ‘normal’ everyday tasks and routines, things like our work, career’s or our relationships with others. 
					If the addictive behaviour effects our ability to function properly, then it is safe to assume it is an addiction or a problematic behaviour, which may benefit from addiction counselling.</p>
					<p>Addictions may come about as a result of a person having some other issue going on in their lives, sometimes called an underlying issue. 
					This is especially the case with alcohol addiction. Alcohol addiction counselling is very effective.</p>

					<h2>Alcohol &amp; Drugs</h2>
					<p>Alcohol & Drugs can be effective in numbing pain, both physical and emotional. Many people start using alcohol and or drugs as a strategy for blocking out pain and whist the strategy may block out the underlying issue, be it emotional or physical pain, it also brings it’s own unique problems. 
					Physical and psychological dependency to alcohol and or drugs and several physical ailments may result from excessive or prolonged periods of drinking and or drug taking or the use of other prescribed or illicit medicines.
					It is vital that specific addiction counselling is sought.</p>

					<h2>Physical Addiction</h2>
					<p>Physical addiction on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic withdrawal symptoms when the substance or behaviour is suddenly stopped. While Opioids, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Alcohol and Nicotine are all well known for their ability to Induce physical dependence, other categories of substances share this property and are not considered addictive.</p>

					<section class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					<h2>Smoking (Nicotine addiction)</h2>
					<p>Smokers report that a cigarette can be pleasurable, but there is a medical consensus that the user is likely fulfilling his/her physical addiction and, therefore, is achieving pleasurable feelings relative to his/her previous state of physical withdrawal. 
					The physical dependency of the nicotine addict on the substance itself becomes an overwhelming factor in the continuation of most users’ addictions.</p>
					<p>Addiction counselling helps to address the underlying life issues which can lead to addictions. An experienced counsellor (therapist) will be able to offer safe and tested advice and addiction counselling for all addictions.</p>

					<h2>Emotional addiction</h2>
					<p>Psychological addiction is a dependency of the mind, and leads to psychological withdrawal symptoms (such as cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression, anorexia etc).
					Addiction can in theory be derived from any rewarding behaviour and is believed to be strongly associated with the dopaminergic system of the brain’s reward system (as in the case of cocaine and amphetamines). </p>

					<h2>Sex &amp; Porn Addiction issues<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
					<p>Worried you have a sex addiction? Whether you feel you are addicted to porn, or you feel you have an unhealthy sex addiction or a problematic sex drive (very low or very high).
					You may have a sexual interest in things which feel outside accepted norms, or the norms of society, or maybe you’re worried about sexual thoughts, fantasies or anything to do with sex.</p>
					<p>It may help to share your worries anonymously with an online addiction counsellor who can offer you a non-judgemental listening ear in all aspects of sexual addictions.
					I have supported people with different types of sex addiction, both men and women. Your worries will be sensitively, but openly explored so that you get answers and a greater understanding of your urges, fantasies or worries.
					I will help you to explore whatever your sex addiction or worry is.</p>
					<p>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is the model which most sex addiction counsellors and therapists use, it focusses on thoughts and behaviours, whilst it is also important to explore any historic issues which can affect our individual sex addiction or preferences.</p>

					<p>It may be helpful to think of an addiction as a learned behaviour and it may have been learned over a long period of time, but it can be unlearned and changed too. Many people successfully kick destructive addictions or habits and live a more fulfilling life with the help of an addiction counsellor.</p>
