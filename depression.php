						<h2>What is depression?<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<p>Depression is the most commonly diagnosed of all the mental health issues, also closely associated with Anxiety, often both conditions go hand in hand. Depression counselling is the single most effective tool to improve mood and thinking.
						People often use phrases like “I’m depressed” to describe a temporary low mood, of feeling lost, hopeless, low, having no energy, or how they are feeling about a particular situation in their life. 
						Depression counselling has proved to be an effective treatment.</p>
						<p>In most cases, these low spirits lift of their own accord after a short period of time. However, if these feelings of unhappiness worsen and begin to interfere with how we live our everyday life, then it is possible that we may be developing a major or clinical depression.
						The word “clinical” simply means that the condition is severe enough to need some form of medical treatment which combined with depression counselling offers the best chance of improvement.</p>

						<h2>How Depression counselling can help and support you</h2>
						<p>If you are experiencing depression, you may feel unhappy, or feel low, that everything you do is a struggle, and perhaps not worth the effort. Often people experiencing depression feel hopeless about the future and unable to see any positives in life. 
						You may feel flat and unable to participate in activities you used to enjoy. Sleeping problems may be an issue too.</p>
						<p>At its worst, depression can lead to such feelings of helplessness and lack of self-worth that people may give up the will to live, or begin to have suicidal thoughts 
						Working with an Online Counsellor offers people living with depression a more accessible service, no need to travel or leave your home. It is safe and secure and completely confidential, you can even remain anonymous if you prefer.</p>
