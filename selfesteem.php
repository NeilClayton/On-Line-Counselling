						<h1>Self Esteem Issue's</h1>

						<h2>What are self esteem issues?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<h3>We all use the expression ‘self esteem’ but what do we mean by it</h3>
						<p>Some people think that self esteem means confidence, and of course confidence comes into it, but self esteem is more than confidence. Self esteem is the genuine manner in which we truly feel about ourselves. </p>
						<p>There are many successful people who would in private admit that they have low self esteem. To the outside world low self esteem can be disguised by a real or pseudo confidence. 
						You may have heard the phrase ‘fake it to make it’ well many people use that strategy to compensate for a low self esteem.</p>

						<h2>What are self esteem issues?<b class="pull-right">(3)</b></h2>
						<p>If you find yourself thinking or saying any of these things, you may benefit from working on your self esteem with a therapist. The great news is that we can all improve how we feel about ourselves. 
						Not everyone will say these things out loud but many people may feel this way inside.</p>
						<p>Your self-esteem is how well you think about yourself compared to other people, such as friends and workmates. Low self esteem means that you think you are a lesser person than others.
						It can often be traced back to early childhood experiences, such as heavy criticism, being abandoned, feeling unloved, feeling unattractive, too fat or too thin being ridiculed or abused. </p>
						<h3>Here’s a quick test, ask yourself these questions and answer honestly</h3>
						<ul class="numbers">
							<li>Do I like myself?</li>
							<li>Do I think I’m a good human being?</li>
							<li>Am I someone deserving of love?</li>
							<li>Do I deserve happiness?</li>
							<li>Do I really feel – both in my mind and deep in my guts that I’m an OK person?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>People with low self esteem find it hard to answer ‘yes’ to these questions.</p>

						<h2>Raising your self esteem</h2>
						<p>Counselling and short-term cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) are very helpful for most people with low self esteem. It allows a person to clear out the cobwebs and release their inhibitions step by step. 
						Raising self esteem enables you to feel better about yourself and recognise your good qualities. Your relationships improve, and you become a happier person.</p>
						<p>Working with an online counsellor is the best way to do this. If you would like to improve your self esteem, self esteem therapy really does work and the benefits last a life time. </p>
