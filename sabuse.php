						<h1>Abuse</h1>
						<p>​Abuse comes in many forms, Sexual, Physical, Financial, Emotional, Domestic Abuse, Neglect and Bullying, at home or at work. Sometimes, we may not feel we’re being abused because it may have happened gradually and usually by people who are close to us or troubled and may have issues themselves. If you or someone you love is effected by abuse, then abuse counselling will help.</p>
						<p>Most abuse happens because the abuser takes away our control, if it’s a secret then they hold all the power. To stop abuse we must speak out, if we speak out, even if we only tell one other person who we can trust, we start to take back some control, this is the beginning of recovery from abuse. Find someone you can trust and talk to them about what is happening, do it today and take some control back in your life, abuse counselling will help you regain that control.</p>
						<p>Online abuse counselling is very accessible to people who are controlled as it can be accessed from the safety of your own home or work place.</p>

					<h2>Sexual abuse</h2>
					<p>Is any form of touching, intercourse, or exploitation of your body. This includes taking pictures of you for sexual purposes, asking you to touch someone else’s private parts, and making sexual references to your body. Being forced to touch or have sex with your boyfriend or girlfriend against your will is also sexual abuse.</p>
					<p>Abusive relationships can make you feel ashamed, but its not your fault. Sexual abuse will almost always require an abuse counsellor to work through the complex issues and emotions with you.</p>

					<h2>Historic sexual abuse<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
					<p>If you are reading this there is likelihood that you or someone you care about has been a victim of historic sexual abuse, it may go back many years and you may be wondering or have wondered all those years whether it was in fact sexual abuse. If you are still wondering this so many years after it took place, then I feel we can safely accept that it was sexual abuse and that you have carried it, either in the deepest part of your conscious mind, or that you have tried your best not to think about it for a very long time.</p>
					<p>We have arrived at a moment in time when you are more likely than ever before to be able to share what happened and be heard and believed than at any time since the sexual abuse took place. Why, because there have been so many big name revelations and finally authorities involved in supporting survivors of historic sexual abuse.</p>
					<p>Many survivors of historic sexual abuse have found that they wanted to talk to the authorities about what happened, but for many more the headlines and countless press articles which seem to be everywhere at the moment has raised the feelings and emotions to the forefront, you may be struggling to keep a lid on your pain and emotions and your friendships and relationships may be suffering as a result.</p>
					<p>The reason I have added this page to my website is to provide online counselling for survivors of historic sexual abuse and to support you in a different way, many survivors don’t want to go to the police or aren’t ready, you may never want to take that step, but you may need the support which can help you to get through this once and for all. </p>

					<p>Counselling isn’t necessarily about reliving the actual sexual abuse and what happened, some people don’t want that, some do, but what can be helpful are exploring the things that  you might be ready for and therapeutic tools which will help you to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Manage your emotions and feelings</li>
						<li>Help you build trust</li>
						<li>Function better in your relationships</li>
						<li>Feel happier about your self</li>
						<li>Get closure to the historic sexual abuse</li>
						<li>Learn to live a happier life</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many survivors of historic sexual abuse find that online counselling offers them a safe way to explore their hurt and pain, and if you want to you can be anonymous, you can access it from a place you find comfortable and safe, work, home, even in your car on a mobile phone via skype.</p>

					<p>No one else needs to know, I don’t keep records and I work alone. 
					I have worked with survivors of historic sexual abuse, children and adults in my time with the NSPCC and with other organisations, as well as working with many others online via my online counselling websit</p>
					<p>If you would like to find a permanent way forward and get some closure, most survivors of historic sexual abuse choose to work with me by typechat at skype, I won’t see you and you won’t see me, unless you prefer it that way, you will benefit from expressing your feelings and from simple therapeutic tools to help you move forward with a happier and more peaceful life.	</p>
					<p>Many survivors of historic sexual abuse have found that they wanted to talk to the authorities about what happened, but for many more the headlines and countless press articles which seem to be everywhere at the moment has raised the feelings and emotions to the forefront, you may be struggling to keep a lid on your pain and emotions and your friendships and relationships may be suffering as a result.</p>
