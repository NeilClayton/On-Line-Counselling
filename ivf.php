						<h2>The Role Of Counselling During IVF<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<p>Trying to conceive can be stressful. Anyone facing the fear and uncertainty associated with invasive investigations and treatment can experience a wide range of emotions including: anger, fear, frustration, envy, guilt, negativity, lack of confidence, loss of control and low self-esteem. 
						Some people feel isolated from friends and family, and couples may find it difficult to relate to each other.</p>
						<p>Having been through Infertility Treatment and IVF myself I firmly believe in the role of fertility counselling as an integral part of treatment.
						I understand the physical as well as the emotional aspects of fertility. I can provide support at any stage of your fertility journey â€“ from contemplating whether or not you want to start a family (or have another child) through to all stages of investigations and treatment to IVF and beyond.</p>
						<p>Anyone considering egg, sperm (or embryo) donation or planning surrogacy is strongly recommended to have fertility counselling to help them consider the implications for themselves and their future child in the short and long-term.</p>

						<h2>The Role Of Counselling During IVF<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<p>As a counsellor specialising in reproductive and pregnancy related issues, I know how to help you get through this difficult journey and cope with intense feelings.
						I can help you find your way to feeling good about yourself and your life again. I have been fortunate to provide therapy to many women and couples who were able to regain their strength going through the process of trying to conceive </p>
						<p>Research shows that early psychological intervention can effectively decrease emotional distress, depression and anxiety. As a counsellor with expertise and personal experience in the area. 
						I can help you move through this time feeling supported and to regain the strength.</p>
