					<h2>Signs and Symptoms of a gambling addiction problem</h2>
					<p>If Gambling is having a negative effect on your life, this is a clear indication that it is a problem. An early warning sign for the gambler may be an experience of euphoria in the event of winning (often accompanied by an urge to win more) and an increasing low when losing. The cycle usually begins when the gambler begins chasing the perceived loss.</p>
					<p>Those around the gambler may experience subtle changes such as mood swings or more disturbing indications i.e. increased demands for cash or social withdrawal. This can be quite frightening for both parties. It’s normal and often appropriate to feel anxiety around these issues.
					Now may be the time to talk to an online counsellor with experience of gambling addiction.</p>
