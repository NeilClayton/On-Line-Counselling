						<h2>Why do people self harm?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<p>There are lots of reasons why people might self-harm. The need to hurt yourself usually comes from emotions that are very difficult to cope with or express .
						People might self-harm because it's a way of releasing tension or controlling something. It’s a physical pain that you can deal with, rather than an emotional feeling that you might find hard to cope with.</p>
						<p>Self-harm can also be used as a way of self-punishment for something you feel bad about. The reasons for self-harming can be very personal so it's okay if you don't know why you self-harm. 
						Whatever you're going through, I’m here for you. You don’t have to deal with things on your own. </p>
						<h3>There are many ways that someone might self-harm, including:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Cutting or scratching.</li>
							<li>Causing bruises.</li>
							<li>Banging their head against a wall.</li>
							<li>Pulling out hair.</li>
							<li>Burning.</li>
							<li>Falling over on purpose.</li>
							<li>Intentionally breaking a bone.</li>

						Self harm can be a scary and lonely experience and getting support can be really important.</p>
						<p>There are lots of myths about the kind of people who self-harm, however it's clear that self-harm is something that people from all walks of life can struggle with. 
						This does not depend on your sex, age, religion or background. The important fact to remember is that you are not alone in this.</p>
						<p>People have different triggers for starting to self-harm. Some people start self-harming after being abused or bullied. It could be a reaction to a stressful event. 
						Other people self-harm because of pressure in life or because they feel alone. It doesn't have to be a big thing. An argument or a situation that made them feel embarrassed or left you feeling depressed might lead to someone self-harming.</p>

						<h2>How do I tell someone I'm self-harming?</h2>
						<p>Often it can be difficult for someone to understand why they are self-harming, so explaining it to another person can be really hard. Lots of people have said talking to someone is one of the best ways to cope with wanting to self-harm.

						It’s important to remember that you are never alone I am here to listen to you</p>

						I would never judge you or tell you to stop self harming – I understand how addictive self harming can be, and used as a way of coping with your thoughts and feelings but I can work with you to help you find better ways of coping.</p>
						<p>Self harm can be a scary and lonely experience and getting support can be really important, my extensive work with young people and adults has helped me realise that clients can sometimes feel immensely alone, and they feel isolated as they face the pain they feel inside, 
						I recognise that this pain can be so strong and hard to bear that clients can wonder about options that involve harming themselves. </p>
