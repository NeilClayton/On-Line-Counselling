						<h2>Pregnancy Loss</h2>
						<p>Losing a baby at any point during pregnancy can be a physically and emotionally devastating experience. It can feel like your whole world has fallen apart​
						Most people are left with feelings of great sadness and regret.</p>
						<p>You may feel shocked and confused. You may feel angry – at fate, at your partner, at other women who seem to have no problems getting and staying pregnant.
						You might feel guilty and wonder whether you have been responsible for your loss in some way. You may feel empty and perhaps lonely.</p>
						<p>Some women lose confidence, feel stressed, panicky and out of control. If you didn’t plan the pregnancy or if you didn’t want to be pregnant, you may find it hard to understand your emotions.
						You might feel completely different to the way you thought you would.</p>
						<p>You might feel a mixture of loss, relief and guilt. Many women – and partners too – find it difficult to be around anyone else who is pregnant or has a new baby.
						It’s certainly very common and natural to feel jealous and to feel that this is all very unfair.</p>
						<p>For some people, their feelings are intense but not overwhelming. Others are devastated by what they feel and for a time feel barely able to cope. Everyday tasks, whether at home or at work, can seem impossible to manage or not worth doing. 
						The world can feel turned upside down.</p>

						<h2>Physical Feelings<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<h3>It is also common to feel loss in physical ways.</h3>
						<p>A lot of women find they feel very tired, even some time after the loss. You may also have headaches or stomach-aches, be constipated, have diarrhoea, or find it hard to sleep.
						These symptoms will probably disappear in time, but if you feel worried about them, it might be a good idea to talk to your GP.</p>
						<p>If you haven’t been able to tell your family, friends or partner about your miscarriage – or if you don’t have a partner – then you may feel very lonely and isolated.</p>

						<h3>A particular kind of loss</h3>
						<p>Loss of a baby is a particular kind of loss and can bring particular feelings.you might grieve for a person you never got know, and for a relationship that ended before it really began.
						Sometimes the words ‘loss’ and ‘losing’ somehow does not feel right. You might think that ‘losing a baby’ sounds like something to be blamed for, as if you were careless. That’s certainly not what is meant when we use these words  </p>

						<h2>How counselling helps<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<p>As a counsellor specialising in reproductive and pregnancy related issues, I know how to help support you through your sadness and other intense feelings.
						I can help you find your way to feeling good about yourself and your life again. I have personaly experienced loss several time myself, and have experienced the impact it can bring.
						I have been fortunate to provide therapy to many women and couples who were able to regain their strength after their loss</p>
						<p>Although how you feel about your loss may heal with time, research shows that early psychological intervention can effectively decrease emotional distress, depression and anxiety in the first year after your loss.</p>
