						<h1>Confidentiality</h1>
						<p>Everything you say to me will be private and confidential. I would only have to break the confidentiality if I felt that your life or another personâ€™s life was in immediate danger, I would always talk to you about it first giving you as much control as possible.
						This is what the BACP (British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy) says about privacy and confidentiality.</p>

						<h2>What is confidentiality?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<p>Confidentiality is essential in a therapy relationship as part of building trust. (BACP Ethical Framework for Good Practice in Counselling and Psychotherapy [2010]) However, confidentiality is not absolute, and there are exceptions. Sometimes, in the public interest, counsellors may need to make a referral to an agency or organisation (for example GP, police or social services) when there is a serious risk of imminent harm to their clients or to others, for example where a client is seriously mentally ill and needs hospitalisation, or in cases of child or elder abuse.</p>

						<h2>What is confidentiality?<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<p>These referrals are usually (but not always) made with the client's knowledge and consent. This decision will depend on the particular circumstances of each client.
						There may be times when a therapist is required by law to break confidentiality, for example, about terrorist activities. It may also be a criminal offence to 'tip off' a client when such a disclosure has to be made. See BACP Information Sheet G2 'Breaching Confidentiality', available at www.bacp.co.uk.</p>

						<h2>How confidentiality works</h2>
						<p>Disclosures may sometimes be made at the client's request, for example, where a client asks for help when they are the victim of abuse, or for an assessment or report to help with a court case involving a claim for damages by the client.
						You and your therapist should talk together in their first session and reach agreement about the limits of confidentiality for your work together.</p>
						<p>Therapists do not make telephone calls or engage in discussions about you to your GP, employer, partner, family members, friends or to other agencies to find out, clarify, or add to your personal information without your knowledge.
						This would be an absolute breach of confidentiality and trust.</p>
