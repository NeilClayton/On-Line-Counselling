						<h2>What are unhelpful thinking patterns?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<p>Our brain generates thousands of thoughts each day. Some thoughts are really useful, absolute gold, while others are unhelpful and best left to one side.</p>
						<p>Every now and again we can all get into unhelpful patterns of thinking. When someone has experienced significant trauma, or had a series of setbacks, unhelpful patterns of thinking can become ‘locked in’, almost as an automatic response in unfamiliar or challenging situations.
						Listed below are some unhelpful patterns thinking to watch out for, plus ways to disengage and get you back on track. By naming these thought patterns for what they are, you can step back from them and make a decision whether to put more energy into them — or not.</p>

						<h3>Stewing or Contemplating</h3>
						<p>Stewing or contemplating is where you find yourself running things repetitively over and over in your mind, like a tape loop, without any fresh input or action being taken. 
						Typically, stewing or contemplating leads to problems growing in size and appearing even more difficult to deal with.</p>
						<h3>Catastrophising and over Generalising</h3>
						<p>Catastrophising and over-generalising is where you take a single event or limited piece of information, and see it as a global pattern (usually a negative one). 
						If you hear yourself using words like ‘always’ or ‘never’, these are hints that you might be catastrophising or over generalising (e.g. ‘I’m always stuffing things up’, ‘I never get a fair go’).</p>
						<h3>All or Nothing Thinking</h3>
						<p>All or nothing thinking, or black or white thinking, is where things are either all good OR all bad. It’s either one extreme or the other; there are no grey areas.</p>

						<h3>Shoulds or Musts</h3>
						<p>Shoulding and musting is where you focus on how you perceive things ‘should’ or ‘must’ be, rather than how it is. Shoulding and musting can pressure you to do things one particular way or the ‘right way’. 
						These might be pressures regarding yourself, or other people in your life.</p>
						<h3>Totalising or Labelling</h3>
						<p>Totalising thinking takes a single mistake, problem or shortcoming, and gets you to see yourself – your identity — entirely through that lens. (e.g. ‘I spilled my drink, I’m such a loser’). Common labels include ‘loser’, ‘idiot’, etc. 
						Sometimes this pattern of thinking has you labelling others.</p>
						<h3>Mind Reading</h3>
						<p>This is when you ‘know’ what someone else is thinking, even though you have no idea what they are thinking. It often takes the form of an assumption that another person is making a negative judgement about you.</p>
						<h3>Discounting the Positive</h3>
						<p>You reject positive experiences by insisting that they “don’t count”. For example, if you have a positive interaction with someone, you write it off as a one-off, or attribute it solely to the other person’s actions and not seeing your own part. Discounting the positives takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded.</p>

						<h3>Forecasting</h3>
						<p>When you predict that something will turn out badly, or you will stuff things up, without there being any evidence. Forecasting can get in the way of taking action to make things better.</p>
						<h3>Funnelling</h3>
						<p>Funnelling is when you interpret every difficulty as a result of the abuse you experienced. For example, if you feel stressed about something at work, funnelling puts this down to some personal failure resulting from the abuse, rather than identifying that there might actually be things that would cause most people to feel stressed.</p>
						<h3>Emotional Reasoning</h3>
						<p>You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are. “I feel guilty. I must be a rotten person.” Or, “I feel angry. This proves that I’m being treated unfairly.” Or, “I feel so inferior. This means I’m a second rate person.” Or, “I feel hopeless. Things must really be hopeless.”</p>
