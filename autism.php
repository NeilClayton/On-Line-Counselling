				<h2>How it affects people</h2>
				<p>​People with Autism an Asperger’s can be extremely able at certain things, which require certain strengths, yet can find other things extremely difficult. For example they might have extremely advanced music skills, yet low functioning linguistic skills.
					It is common for autistic people to have extremely high skills in certain areas and have a lot of trouble with other areas.</p>
				<p> People with Autism can have trouble with executive function – the set of abilities that enable people to work towards goals.
					These include time management, initiating appropriate actions, inhibiting inappropriate actions, flexibility and selecting relevant sensory information. This can make it difficult to organise an everyday task.</p>
				<p> Instead of visualising a list of tasks, a person with Autism or Asperger’s might remember everything they need to do at random and at different times, which can feel chaotic.
					Everyday tasks such as this can feel very tiring, which might mean that autistic people struggle with persevering at such tasks.</p>

				<h2>What is the Autistic spectrum?</h2>
				<p>Often, Autism diagnosis is described as a spectrum. People with Autism have widely varying experiences of autism, and having worked with people with Autism and Asperger’s I feel that it is not as simple as “from low to high functioning”.
					If you mapped the experiences of every autistic person, it would look more like a constellation in the galaxy – with every star having a new set of experiences and abilities.</p>

				<h2>My thoughts</h2>
				<h3>A final thought when it comes to counselling and Autism and Aspregers</h3>
				<p>Some people with Autism an Asperger’s have found ways of coping in the world – and this often shows in finding ways of fitting in. This may involve learning behaviours that fit into social norms, but do not come naturally to them.</p>
				<h3>This can be exhausting</h3>
				<p>A good therapists should be more aware of these strains that may be on their clients. I have experience of working with client with all types of learning social difficulties including Autism an Asperger’s</p>
