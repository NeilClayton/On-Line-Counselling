						<h2>Never give up</h2>
						<p>Just as your suicidal thoughts took time to develop, they may take some time to go away - but they will fade. Even if you can’t imagine a way out now, the way you are thinking and feeling about things will change. 
						No matter how bad things have become, these thoughts won’t last forever and you will eventually start to see things differently. There are often many different ways to change a difficult situation. </p>
						<h3>Talk to a counsellor</h3>
						<p> Talking to a counsellor about how you feel is a really important part of getting help. However, this isn’t always easy to do. Opening up to someone and describing how you feel can be really difficult.
						It’s a good idea to plan and prepare what you want to say. What are the main things you want to get out of talking to someone? Do you want some advice, or do you just want to express yourself and get your feelings off your chest?</p>
