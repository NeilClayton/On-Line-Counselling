						<h2>What is Post Natal Depression</h2>
						<p>Postnatal depression (PND) is a common problem. It was thought that about one in ten mums suffers from PND but many recent studies have indicated that it may affect  as many as one in five. 
						PND can sometimes be confused with the 'baby blues' which affects at least 80% of new mums and which are thought to be due to the huge hormonal changes that occur after birth.</p>
						<p>However, whereas baby blues can resolve quite quickly, PND is unlikely to go away without the right support and treatment. Postnatal depression can include difficulties in bonding with your baby but this is absolutely not always the case.</p>

						<h2>I offer Counselling</h2>
						<p>I also offer counselling for those feeling depressed during pregnancy and for those concerned about their risk of developing PND. I have helped many new parents through this transition and have witnessed the positive changes and the growing sense of confidence that having our support can bring about.
						If you are struggling with this talk to an online counsellor who has experience of working with children,teenagers and parents </p>
						<p>Talk to me I am an experienced online therapist who has worked directly with young children and teenagers online and face to face. I have a wealth of understanding which parents find extremely useful in learning to understand their children and their changing relationships.</p>
